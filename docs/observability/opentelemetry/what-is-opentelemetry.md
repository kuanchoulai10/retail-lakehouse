# What is OpenTelemetry?

!!! quote 

    OpenTelemetry **is** an **observability framework** and toolkit designed to facilitate the **generation**, **export**, **collection** of telemetry data such as **traces**, **metrics**, and **logs**.
    
    OpenTelemetry **is not** an observability backend itself. --- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/)
